<p align="center"> Sleep Well project utilizes the Wio Terminal as a powerful tool for monitoring the sleep environment and providing users with valuable insights into their sleep quality. Through continuous data collection of temperature, humidity, light, and noise levels throughout the night, the system generates a comprehensive sleep quality score. This score serves as a reliable metric for users to evaluate the effectiveness of their sleep and make informed decisions to enhance their overall sleep experience.

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Our project aims to leverage the Wio Terminal, an Arduino-based device, to monitor sleep environments and provide users with valuable insights into their sleep quality. By collecting data on temperature, humidity, light, and noise levels throughout the night, our project enables users to gain a comprehensive understanding of their sleep patterns. The collected data is analyzed and presented to users through a simple score, indicating the quality of their sleep. By providing easy access to this information via a mobile application, our project empowers users to make informed decisions about their sleep habits and improve their overall sleep quality.


## ‚å®Ô∏è Features <a name = "Features"></a>
* Real-time monitoring of temperature, humidity, light, and noise levels during sleep.
* Data collection and storage for analysis.
* Calculation of sleep quality score based on collected data.
* Visualization of sleep patterns and trends.
* Notifications and alerts for abnormal sleep conditions.
* User-friendly mobile application interface.

##  User Manual <a name = "user_manual"></a>
Wio:
<br>

There are 5 different buttons, making the screen view different things:<br>
Up: Light sensor information only.<br>
Left: Loudness sensor information only.<br>
Down: Temperature sensor information only.<br>
Right: Humidity sensor information only.<br>
Press: All sensor values at the same time (Home Screen).

App:<br>

- Home Screen: From here, you can either start taking a nap by clicking on the bed, look at the previous days data by clicking on the calendar icon on the right side of the screen.

<br>
- log screen: There are two buttons, top left of the screen to go back to the Home Screen and clicking on "More Details" for everyday gives more indepth information about that certain day.

<br>
- Sleep Screen: Once you are here, the Wio is recording and sending values to the App. You can stop this and end the session by sliding the slide. That way, ending the napping session.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
[]()

To get started with your GitLab project for Arduino and Flutter, follow these steps:

1. Set up [Arduino](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360019833020-Download-and-install-Arduino-IDE) and [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) frameworks: Before proceeding, make sure you have both Arduino and Flutter frameworks installed on your system.

2. Prepare Wio Seeed Terminal: To upload code to the Wio Seeed Terminal using Arduino IDE, ensure you have the terminal device connected to your system. Additionally, connect the necessary sensors to the terminal, as they will be used in the project.

3. Before utilizing GitLab, ensure that [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) is installed on your device. 

4. [Clone](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) the repository: To begin working on the project, clone the repository to your local machine. This will create a local copy of the project that you can modify and contribute to. 

5. Utilize MQTT protocol: The project makes use of the MQTT protocol, and the developers have chosen to use mosquitto for this purpose. Familiarize yourself with MQTT and set up [mosquitto](https://git.chalmers.se/courses/dit113/2023/group-1/sleep-well/-/wikis/Instruction#mqtt-configuration) to enable communication within the project.

6. Run project automated: You need to open your terminal, and open the path of the flutter project, 
`C:\...\sleep-well\sleep_well` 
then write command
`bulid.bat`


## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>
As metioned above, the project measures environmental variables during sleep to optimize sleep conditions and has potential applications in research. It provides a score indicating whether the sleeping environment was favorable or unfavorable, which can be used to adjust conditions to improve sleep quality. By analyzing the data collected, patterns and trends can be iSdentified, contributing to a better understanding of factors that influence sleep quality.


## Prerequisites <a name = "Prerequisites"></a>

* Flutter SDK <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install" target="Flutter">(installation guide)</a>  
* Dart SDK <a href="https://dart.dev/get-dart" target="Dart">(installation guide)</a>  



### Installing
